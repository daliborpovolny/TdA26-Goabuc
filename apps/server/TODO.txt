FINISH quiz move to module stuff

Add more module endpoint stuff -- somethings missing don't know now what
- i think i've remembered - endpoint state doesn't do shit now

- add a flip variable for deciding wheather course detail should return the data in just the module format or also the individual lists

to items in the 'items' field of each module add a type property?? - so that frontend knows what items it's looking at
